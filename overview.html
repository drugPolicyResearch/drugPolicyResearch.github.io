			<p class="exploreText">What is drug decriminalization and legalization?</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText">First, it's important to differentiate <b>decriminalization</b> and
				<b>legalization</b>.
				Drug <b>decriminalization</b> is the elimination of criminal penalities for drug use and
				possession. This generally includes:
				<ul class="exploreSubText">
					<li>Removing penalties for personal drug use</li>
					<li>Removing penalties for small or large amounts of possession</li>
					<li>Allowing the possession of equipment for drug use (i.e. syringes)</li>
					<li>Disregarding low-level drug sales</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText">
				Drug <b>legalization</b> pertains to the elimination of law limiting drug use,
				possession, and
				sale. States may choose to only legalize certain stages in the pipeline, among the
				following:
				<ul class="exploreSubText">
					<li>Legalizing medical use</li>
					<li>Legalizing recreational use</li>
					<li>Removing limits on possession</li>
					<li>Legalizing manufacturing and sale</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div class="topic">
			<hr />
			<p class="exploreText">Drug decriminalization and legalization is becoming more widely accepted.
			</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText"> Over the past 50 years, there has been a surge in global opinions on
				drug
				decriminalization. Many countries have made pushes towards progressive drug policy.
				Among these
				countries are:
			</p>
			<ul class="exploreSubText">
				<li>Canada, legalized recreational marijuana in October 2018</li>
				<li>Portugal, which was the first country to decriminalize all drugs</li>
				<li>Uruguay, legalized marijuana completely in December 2013</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="exploreSubText"> Currently in the United States, 10 states and the District of
				Columbia have
				legalized recreational
				use of marijuana and 33 have legalized medical marijuana. Drug legalization is becoming
				more
				widely accepted, with 62% of surveyed Americans supporting the legalization of marijuana
				according to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey. </p>
			<p class="exploreSubText"> Each of these countries has had varying success with their
				progressive
				policies, but undoubtedly <i>there seems to be an emerging trend of countries adopting
					more
					progressive drug laws.</i></p>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div class="topic">
			<hr />
			<p class="exploreText">Certain groups of people fall victim to drug laws.</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText">Yet, despite this rising acceptance, more than 2 million people,
				predominantly
				African American, are currently incarcerated for possession of small amounts of
				marijuana.
				According to a 2018 report by prisonpolicy.org, 1 in 5 incarcerated people is locked up
				for a
				drug offense. </p>
			<p class="exploreSubText">While there are many cultural stereotypes about income and addiction,
				such as
				that primarily the poor are victims of substance abuse and that the wealthy who are
				addicted to
				drugs are morally weak, drug abuse can be found in <i>all socioeconomic classes and
					income
					levels</i> for a variety of reasons. This fact begs the idea that socioeconomic
				class
				needs to be taken into account whenever considering the implications of a potential drug
				law.
			</p>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div class="topic">
			<hr />
			<p class="exploreText">These are the most relevant issues to drug policy.</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText"><b>Law Enforcement:</b> Usually one of the more innocuous issue
				topics, the
				influence that drug legalization and decriminalization have on Law Enforcement is
				immediate.
				Although is obvious that both legalization and decriminalization affect Law Enforcement
				through
				the new legality of certain substances, but this issue has further reaching, more
				evasive
				consequences. A few of these implications are:</p>
			<ul class="exploreSubText">
				<li>Public spending / allocation of taxpayer money</li>
				<li>Influence of drug cartels</li>
				<li>Incarceration and criminal charges, and its effect on socioeconomic class</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="exploreSubText"><b>Healthcare:</b> Since the longterm health effects of certain
				substances are
				the target of current research, both the lack of knowledge and the observed health
				effects of
				each of these subsstances is often used as talking points in many drug legislation
				debates.</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText"><b>Economy:</b> Specifically, legalization of certain substances
				(mainly
				marijuana) may have an impact on the nation's economy. This many be due to the fact that
				legalization will permit the purchase and sale of previously illegal substances creating
				new
				markets in the US.</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText"><b>Poverty:</b> A large part of the drug legistlation debate is the
				effect
				that certain policies will have on various socioeconomic classes. Particularly, the most
				used
				socioeconomic class to debate over drug legislation is low-income, and often debate
				centers
				around how propsoed legislation will impact the lives of those less privileged. </p>
			<br />
		</div>
		<div class="topic">
			<hr />
			<p class="exploreText">There are two competing narratives over more drug legislation.</p>
			<p class="exploreSubText">Essentially, there are two sides to every drug legislation debate:
				those who
				support the advancement of more <b>lenient</b> policy, and those who are proponents of
				the
				<b>status quo</b>. Some of their viewpoints are given below: </p>
			<p class="exploreSubText"><b>Pro-lenient Policy Proponents:</b></p>
			<ol type="a" class="exploreSubText">
				<li>Decriminalization of certain substances (specifically marijuana), would reduce
					public
					spending. </li>
				<li>Decriminalization and legalization would lead to the reduction of crime rates.</li>
				<li>Legalization would result in an increase in economic output of the nation. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="exploreSubText"><b>Pro-status quo Policy Proponents:</b></p>
			<ol type="a" class="exploreSubText">
				<li>Decriminalization of certain substances (specifically marijuana), would increase
					public
					spending.</li>
				<li>Decriminalization and legalization would lead to the increase of crime rates.</li>
				<li>Decriminalizing certain substances would have negative effects on the health of
					different
					parts of the population. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="exploreSubText">It is crucial to recognize at this point that each side uses evidence
				to claim
				the issues from the previous section to justify their stance. For example, a Pro-lenient
				Policy
				supporter will say that decriminalization will lead to reduction time and money spent in
				law
				enforcement, thereby reducing public spending. A status quo supporter would rebut this
				by
				claiming that drug users will flood to areas with decriminalization legislation, causing
				a
				strain on city infrastructure, thereby increasing public spending.</p>

			<p class="exploreSubText">We recommend continuing on to the <a href="research.html"
					class="current-item">research</a> section to view our findings on the current
				state of
				drug policy in Houston. Weigh the evidence yourself and see what stance comes out on
