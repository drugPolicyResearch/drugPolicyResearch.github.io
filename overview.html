		<p class="exploreText">What is drug decriminalization and legalization?</p>
		<p class="exploreSubText">First, it's important to differentiate decrminialization and legalization. 
			Drug decriminalization is the elimination of criminal penalities for drug use and possession. This generally includes:
			<ul class="exploreSubText">
				<li>Removing penalties for personal drug use</li>
				<li>Removing penalties for small or large amounts of possession</li>
				<li>Allowing the possession of equipment for drug use (i.e. syringes)</li>
				<li>Disregarding low-level drug sales</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="exploreSubText">
			Drug legalization pertains to the elimination of law limiting drug use, possession, and sale. States may choose to only legalize certain stages in the pipeline, among the following:
			<ul class="exploreSubText">
				<li>Legalizing medical use</li>
				<li>Legalizing recreational use</li>
				<li>Removing limits on possession</li>
				<li>Legalizing manufacturing and sale</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="exploreText">Drug decriminalziation and legalization is becoming more widely accepted.</p>
		<p class="exploreSubText"> Over the past 50 years, there has been a surge in global opinions on drug
			decriminalization. Currently, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational
			use of marijuana and 33 have legalized medical marijuana. Drug legalization is becoming more
			widely accepted, with 62% of surveyed Americans supporting the legalization of marijuana
			according to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey. </p>

		<p class="exploreText">The incarceration rate for certain groups of people hasn't improved.</p>
		<p class="exploreSubText">Yet, despite this rising acceptance, more than 2 million people, predominantly
			African American, are currently incarcerated for possession of small amounts of marijuana.
			According to a 2018 report by prisonpolicy.org, 1 in 5 incarcerated people is locked up for a
			drug offense. </p>
