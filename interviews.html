	  <p>Dr. Harris’s research is focused mainly on alternative drug policies 
			and ways to reduce incarceration and address drug use as a public health 
			issue rather than a criminal justice one. On topic of policies, she comments 
			that people arrested on drug possession charges or drug related crimes may need 
			drug treatment, but some may need other kinds of services. People who are arrested 
			for this stuff often don’t have health care or an identification card. Those are barriers 
			that make it difficult to get other things; we need services to address those other 
			needs, not just diversion programs. Harris firmly supports the decriminalization of 
			weed, stating that action as “a no brainer.” She further asserts that she doesn’t 
			think there should be any penalties for marijuana use or sale. Rather, we should be 
			smarter about how we do it and we should do it in a way that balances with public 
			health. Looking to the future, Dr. Harris is optimistic about where current drug 
			policy shifts are heading and sees drug treatment programs gaining more traction, 
			especially in larger cities.</p>

	    <p>There is a psychological factor for drug use. People are 
		at the risk of turning to drugs when they are dissatisfied 
		with some aspects of their life. Dr. Murguia stated that he supports 
		the decriminalization and legalization of marijuana because it’s a 
		pharmaceutical drug. He commented that drug laws are more strict on minorities, 
		as African-Americans and Mexican-Americans have it particularly harder in Texas. 
		Of particular note, Dr. Murguia believes that states function as “experiments,” 
		so if a drug policy passed in California ends up being successful, 
		then other states are likely to execute the same thing.</p>
		<p>Quotes from the Interview:</p>
		<p>“You have 50 states. They could be regarded as laboratories. So what if California does something right? And all of a sudden it has good results? So it’s like an experiment. So if you look at communities as states that pass progressive legislation, they ought to be imitated...Other states should be encouraged to follow their lead.” <br>
		 - Dr. Murguia compares states to laboratories in order to explain how certain drug policies can potentially impact other states and communities.</p>

	  <p>Franz believes that our current policy better prioritizes our resources, particularly with attorneys who can more valuably spend their time dealing with those accused of assault, robbery, etc -- where there is a real victim in the equation. In the years of Devon Anderson and her predecessors, people would be prosecuted on minor charges and possession, which disproportionally affected people of color and of socioeconomically challenged backgrounds. Franz states that there is an inherent bias towards finding those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds guilty of crimes because that’s where more crimes exist. Often for misdemeanors, it’s a matter of where the action takes place. When it comes to drug legislation in Houston, Franz believes the US needs to relearn from the war on drugs, which resulted in the inhumane treatment of non-violent people and did not decrease drug usage. Policies like STAR Court program need to be adopted on a wider scale, and decriminalization should go beyond marijuana. Franz concluded by warning that despite the good intention of the policies, we need a good implementation that includes proper regulation and oversight. In the end, it’s a matter of getting into the nitty-gritty of how we make sure that the drug industry is regulated just like the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
	  <p>Quotes from the Interview:</p>
	  <p>"One of the reality is that a neighborhood with a lower socioeconomic background generally has more crimes, and that neighborhood is usually where more reinforcement is put in and patrols operate on a fire-alarm basis. There is an inherent bias towards finding people guilty of crimes if they are from a lower socioeconomic background because that’s where more crimes exist. And a lot of times for misdemeanors, it’s a matter of where the action takes place. For example, if two people were to break the same law - smoking marijuana, and one is wealthier and does it in his backyard or car whereas the other lives in an affordable apartment and does it on the street; the second person will be more likely to be charged than the first one."<br>
	  - Franz discusses the inherent classist bias that comes with respect to crime punishment.</p>
	  <p>"I think there is a big difference between taking crack cocaine and marijuana, and so our [national] legal system needs to modernize the way the states did." <br> 
	  - Franz believes that the federal government should follow in the footsteps of the states and legalize marijuana nationally.</p>

	  <p>Interviewed Luis Montoya, the Movement Building Fellow for the Southwest region in SSDP. (Note that his words should not be taken as a direct representation of the views of SSDP as a whole, but should still closely represent SSDP) SSDP is founded upon college students who wanted to make a difference in drug policy reform. Luis lives in Colorado, where they legalized Marijuana and have relatively more progressive laws than Texas. Despite the more "progressive laws", Luis feels that the current drug policies still target African-American and Hispanics more than other races by criminalizing them. A recent drug policy, the Marijuana Justice Act, admits that the War on Drugs undoubtedly has racist connotations. Luis personally supports the decriminalization of both medical and recreational marijuana. He believes that the main indicators of success of a drug policy is whether or not it is improving the lives of those directly impacted by it, particularly racial minorities or lower-income people. Contributing factors to such a success includes reform programs that acknowledge and positively support those affected by the drug policies. In a broader sense, Luis believes that classism (i.e. the disparity between economic levels) is definitely a factor in how someone can be impacted by a drug law differently. But he also states that the drug reform movement is actually a subset of the larger human rights movement, where the solution for drug reformation is closely related to the solution that people seek for equal and human rights for targeted minorities in America.</p>
	  <p>Quotes from the Interview:</p>
	  <p>“The Marijuana Justice Act, that has been introduced by Senator Cory Booker, is basically the only piece of legislation that I know of that acknowledges that the War on Drugs is a racist war.” <br>
	  - Luis discusses the federal bill that has been recently proposed. The new version, if passed, would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and withhold certain federal funding from states that disproportionately enforce marijuana criminalization laws against people of color and low-income individuals.</p>
	  <p>“When it comes to classism within the U.S.,...that unfortunately ties to a bigger problem. So, but when it comes to the War on Drugs, it is just one of many tools of colonialistic oppressive system created by white supremacists. So ultimately, I personally view the War on Drugs and the sort of racial and classist discrimination that stems from it as symptomatic of this underlying assumption that money is going to determine whether or not you’re a good person. And it all ties in together….And it would be fair to say that a good number of our peers view that the mark of ending the War on Drugs as under the larger context of Human Rights Activism.” <br>
	  - Luis connects what his organization is doing to the bigger context of Human Rights Activism by saying that it all ultimately comes down to breaking out of the oppression of disadvantaged groups set up by those with legislative power.</p>
