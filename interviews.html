		 	<p class="explanationText">TLDR: Dr. Harris’s research is focused mainly on alternative drug policies 
				and ways to reduce incarceration and address drug use as a public health 
				issue rather than a criminal justice one. On the topic of policies, she comments 
				that people arrested on drug possession charges or drug related crimes may need 
				drug treatment, but some may need other kinds of services. People who are arrested 
				for this stuff often don’t have health care or an identification card. Those are barriers 
				that make it difficult to get other things; we need services to address those other 
				needs, not just diversion programs. Harris firmly supports the decriminalization of 
				weed, stating that action as “a no brainer.” She further asserts that she doesn’t 
				think there should be any penalties for marijuana use or sale. Rather, we should be 
				smarter about how we do it and we should do it in a way that balances with public 
				health. Looking to the future, Dr. Harris is optimistic about where current drug 
				policy shifts are heading and sees drug treatment programs gaining more traction, 
				especially in larger cities.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >"If one of the reasons is to reduce racial disparities then you need to create a legal market that gives back to the communities that were harmed by prohibition. Right now none of that is happening. None of them have a model where minority communities are intended to benefit from legalization."</p>
			<p class="explanationText">When asked about whether marijuana legalization would widen the wealth gap between the rich and poor, Dr. Harris starts by saying that there might be a valid argument in the contrary, but she touches upon the fact that the weed manufacturing industry is mostly white male dominated. She also says that this is further exasperated by the fact that no current states that have implemented progressive policy have made an attempt to give back to minority communites, which are the underprivleged targets of most policy. She also mentions, coincidentally, that the ones passing these laws are heavily influence by venture capitalists, who again are predominantly white males, implying that the arguments of these policies are motivated mostly by profit and not to reduce racial disparity.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >"People arrested on drug possession charges or drug related crimes like theft in connection to supporting a drug habit -- some need drug treatment, some need other kinds of services. People who are arrested for this stuff. They often don’t have health care or an identification card. Those are barriers that make it difficult to get other things. We also need services to address other needs."</p>
			<p class="explanationText"> When asked what she what recommend be done with regards to the ricidivism rates of those who commited a drug offense, Dr. Harris mentions that usually the ones who need help through drug legislation are often the ones who are hurt the most by it, and that we need mechanism to assist those who need help with drug abuse. She also mentions that investing in housing and treatment would be a good step towards solving this unmet need. She then brings up the idea of "one-stop" shops, where they can get all kind of medical treatment, which would greatly benefit this group.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >"Caution against a full fledged commercial market makes sense... but people tend to underestimate the impact of legal laws functioning as a form of prohibition. I think it’s a disingenuous way to look at the problem."</p>
			<p class="explanationText">When asked how does legalization argument fair against the unknown long-term health effects of marijuana, she responded that usually the ones making arguments against legalization underestimate the negative impacts that come about from drug policies that are so similar to prohibition. </p>

			<p class="explanationText">Franz believes that our current policy better prioritizes our resources, particularly with
				attorneys who can more valuably spend their time dealing with those accused of assault,
				robbery, etc -- where there is a real victim in the equation. In the years of Devon
				Anderson and her predecessors, people would be prosecuted on minor charges and
				possession, which disproportionally affected people of color and of socioeconomically
				challenged backgrounds. Franz states that there is an inherent bias towards finding
				those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds guilty of crimes because that’s where more
				crimes exist. Often for misdemeanors, it’s a matter of where the action takes place.
				When it comes to drug legislation in Houston, Franz believes the US needs to relearn
				from the war on drugs, which resulted in the inhumane treatment of non-violent people
				and did not decrease drug usage. Policies like STAR Court program need to be adopted on
				a wider scale, and decriminalization should go beyond marijuana. Franz concluded by
				warning that despite the good intention of the policies, we need a good implementation
				that includes proper regulation and oversight. In the end, it’s a matter of getting into
				the nitty-gritty of how we make sure that the drug industry is regulated just like the
				pharmaceutical industry.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >"One of the reality is that a neighborhood with a lower socioeconomic background generally
				has more crimes, and that neighborhood is usually where more reinforcement is put in and
				patrols operate on a fire-alarm basis. There is an inherent bias towards finding people
				guilty of crimes if they are from a lower socioeconomic background because that’s where
				more crimes exist. And a lot of times for misdemeanors, it’s a matter of where the
				action takes place. For example, if two people were to break the same law - smoking
				marijuana, and one is wealthier and does it in his backyard or car whereas the other
				lives in an affordable apartment and does it on the street; the second person will be
				more likely to be charged than the first one."</p>
			<p class="explanationText"> Franz discusses the inherent classist bias that comes with respect to crime
				punishment.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >"I think there is a big difference between taking crack cocaine and marijuana, and so our
				[national] legal system needs to modernize the way the states did." </p>
			<p class="explanationText">Franz believes that the federal government should follow in the footsteps of the
				states and legalize marijuana nationally.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >"In the end, it’s just a matter of getting into the nitty-gritty of how we are going to make
				sure that this is an industry that’s regulated just like the pharmaceutical industry."
				</p>
			<p class="explanationText">Franz discusses that the legalization of recreational use of marijuana should be
				followed with a proper and effective implementation. Legalizing marijuana will
				inevitably have mixed consequences, and therefore there should be proper regulations and
				oversight that minimizes possible consequences.</p>

			<p class="explanationText">Interviewed Luis Montoya, the Movement Building Fellow for the Southwest region in SSDP.
				(Note that his words should not be taken as a direct representation of the views of SSDP
				as a whole, but should still closely represent SSDP) SSDP is founded upon college
				students who wanted to make a difference in drug policy reform. Luis lives in Colorado,
				where they legalized Marijuana and have relatively more progressive laws than Texas.
				Despite the more "progressive laws", Luis feels that the current drug policies still
				target African-American and Hispanics more than other races by criminalizing them. A
				recent drug policy, the Marijuana Justice Act, admits that the War on Drugs undoubtedly
				has racist connotations. Luis personally supports the decriminalization of both medical
				and recreational marijuana. He believes that the main indicators of success of a drug
				policy is whether or not it is improving the lives of those directly impacted by it,
				particularly racial minorities or lower-income people. Contributing factors to such a
				success includes reform programs that acknowledge and positively support those affected
				by the drug policies. In a broader sense, Luis believes that classism (i.e. the
				disparity between economic levels) is definitely a factor in how someone can be impacted
				by a drug law differently. But he also states that the drug reform movement is actually
				a subset of the larger human rights movement, where the solution for drug reformation is
				closely related to the solution that people seek for equal and human rights for targeted
				minorities in America.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >“The Marijuana Justice Act, that has been introduced by Senator Cory Booker, is basically the
				only piece of legislation that I know of that acknowledges that the War on Drugs is a
				racist war.” </p>
			<p class="explanationText">Luis discusses the federal bill that has been recently proposed. The new version, if
				passed, would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and withhold certain
				federal funding from states that disproportionately enforce marijuana criminalization
				laws against people of color and low-income individuals.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >“When it comes to classism within the U.S. ... that unfortunately ties to a bigger problem.
				So, but when it comes to the War on Drugs, it is just one of many tools of colonialistic
				oppressive system created by white supremacists. So ultimately, I personally view the
				War on Drugs and the sort of racial and classist discrimination that stems from it as
				symptomatic of this underlying assumption that money is going to determine whether or
				not you’re a good person. And it all ties in together….And it would be fair to say that
				a good number of our peers view that the mark of ending the War on Drugs as under the
				larger context of Human Rights Activism.” </p>
			<p class="explanationText">Luis connects what his organization is doing to the bigger context of Human Rights
				Activism by saying that it all ultimately comes down to breaking out of the oppression
				of disadvantaged groups set up by those with legislative power.</p>

			<p class="explanationText">Dr. Murguia explains that there is a psychological factor for drug use. People are
				at the risk of turning to drugs when they are dissatisfied
				with some aspects of their life. Dr. Murguia stated that he supports
				the decriminalization and legalization of marijuana because it’s a
				pharmaceutical drug. He commented that drug laws are more strict on minorities,
				as African-Americans and Mexican-Americans have it particularly harder in Texas.
				Of particular note, Dr. Murguia believes that states function as “experiments,”
				so if a drug policy passed in California ends up being successful,
				then other states are likely to execute the same thing.</p>
			<p class="explanationText" style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.425em; color: black" >“You have 50 states. They could be regarded as laboratories. So what if California does
				something right? And all of a sudden it has good results? So it’s like an experiment. So
				if you look at communities as states that pass progressive legislation, they ought to be
				imitated...Other states should be encouraged to follow their lead.” </p>
