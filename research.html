										The Misdemeanor Marijuana Diversion

										<br> - Applies to people 17 and older
										facing no additional charges other than
										misdemeanor marijuana possession, county
										and city law enforcement officials said.
										<br> - Decriminalizes low-level
										marijuana possession, with officials
										saying on Thursday throwing people in
										jail for having small amounts of pot had
										“no tangible public safety benefit.”
										<br> - Means in most circumstances there
										will be no jail, no tickets, no court
										appearances and no criminal record for
										possession of less than 4 ounces (113
										grams) of marijuana in the city and its
										surrounding county, home to about 4.5
										million people.
										<br> - Under Ogg’s new Marijuana
										Misdemeanor Diversion Program, anyone
										caught with four ounces or less of
										marijuana is given the opportunity to
										attend a drug education course in
										exchange for their possession charges
										being dropped.
										Marijuana is technically still illegal

				<h2 class="section-title">Recommended Future Policies & Conclusion</h2>

				<p style="padding: 0 150px">
					For the people who are arrested on drug possession charges or drug related
					crimes like theft in connection to supporting a drug habit, some need drug
					treatment, and some need other kinds of services. For the people who are
					arrested for these kinds of things, they often don’t have health care or an
					identification card. These are barriers that make it difficult to get other
					things. We also need services to address other needs.<br><br>

					SS and disability assistance, employment and housings, and mental health
					treatment is a really big issue that needs to be addressed. People have to go to
					many places for all these different needs. Those who don’t have reliable
					transportation can’t afford to do so. We need a one stop shops for all these
					things.<br><br>

					On the state level, governments should reduce penalty for possession. Currently,
					less than a gram of marijuana is a felony. This should be a misdemeanor in order
					for local jurisdiction to have discretion over how they handle it. If it was a
					misdemeanor then they could set up a diversion program.
					On the local level, addressing drug use requires much longer term investment in
					education. There should also be assistance in opioid overdoses use, and needle
					exchange programs. <br><br>

					Of course, there are downsides to these recommended policies. For example, if
					people don’t get arrested while they’re under probation, you end up with more
					people under probation, which widens the net of people under government
					surveillance. Also, the rise of fines instead of jail times criminalizes being
					poor because those who are poor cannot pay for the fines. This show that there
					is still a lot to be done in regards to drug policies.<br><br>

					While legalizing marijuana will likely not happen in Texas for a few years,
					there is still a lot to discuss about drug policies and drug use. With the
					opioid epidemic, people are increasingly recognizing that drug treatment is
					important and evidence-based drug treatment is effective. We are optimistic that
					Texas is heading in the direction of more drug reform.
