        <p>Grassroots organizations such as SSDP (Students for Sensible Drug Policies) recognize and acknowledge that the War on Drugs has racist connotations, and mainly targets African-Americans and Hispanics. It also targets economically disadvantaged people, who makes up the majority of drug dealers and drug users. <br>
Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, a left-leaning openly gay Democratic attorney,  intends to build a Democratic model for public safety that challenges the prevailing Republican “tough-on-crime” narrative in Texas.

March 7, 2019.<br>
Waco ISD Superintendent A. Marcus Nelson was arrested in Robertson County, and he was charged with possession of marijuana less than 2 ounces.
Marcus Nelson is an African-American man, and this arrest could be seen as having a racist bias behind it (according to people who are supportive of drug reformation).
Coverage of this (in the link below) reports the case rather objectively, and talks about Nelson’s past as the Superintendent.<br>

The Misdemeanor Marijuana Diversion Program took effect on March 1, 2017.
<br> - Applies to people 17 and older facing no additional charges other than misdemeanor marijuana possession, county and city law enforcement officials said.
<br> - Decriminalizes low-level marijuana possession, with officials saying on Thursday throwing people in jail for having small amounts of pot had “no tangible public safety benefit.”
<br> - Means in most circumstances there will be no jail, no tickets, no court appearances and no criminal record for possession of less than 4 ounces (113 grams) of marijuana in the city and its surrounding county, home to about 4.5 million people.
<br> - Under Ogg’s new Marijuana Misdemeanor Diversion Program, anyone caught with four ounces or less of marijuana is given the opportunity to attend a drug education course in exchange for their possession charges being dropped.
Marijuana is technically still illegal though.<br>Source: https://www.reuters.com/article/houston-area-to-decriminalize-some-low-level-marijuana-possession-idUSKBN15V29Fus-texas-marijuana/

Drug addiction is a social problem. 
There is a definite link between crime and drug addiction.
There are many who believe that treatment for drug addiction should be offered to all those affected. Many others though believe that drug addiction should be treated as a health problem and not a criminal issue. With the right treatment, those affected by addiction can overcome their illnesses and go on to be productive members of society. They will cease to be a drain on society and will start to actively contribute to it instead.<br> Source: https://www.recovery.org.uk/drug-addiction/guide-drug-addiction-social-problem/

      <div class="content">
        <p>People call for additional changes to reduce drug incarceration, and many states are gravitating towards the legalization of medical and recreational marijuana. However, opponents are still fighting for a greater war on drugs. 
According to the DA’s office, through mid-May, nearly 5,200 people had been diverted from the courts through the Misdemeanor Marijuana Program.</p>
